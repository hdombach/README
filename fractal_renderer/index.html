			<h1>Fractal Renderer</h1>
 		</div>
		<p>
			A project was for rendering fractals using raymarching.</br>
			This was my first main project that I worked on.
			I found out about a fractal online called a mandelbulb that could
			be rendered using SDF's. I quickly made a simple renderer
			using Swift and Metal. Over the next couple months, I continued to impliment
			more features. I improved the rendering to be more akin to a raytracer.
			I added setting to change the material and eventually impimented a node graph
			editor to control the shaders (inspired by Blender). Afterwards, I extended 
			the node graph so it could control the SDL as well. </br>
			I sadly can no longer work on it because Apple made an update to XCode that
			caused the project to not compile. I was already getting annoyed at my own design
			decisions for this project and so I have started making a new and improved
			fractal renderer called <a>Kaleidescope</a>.
