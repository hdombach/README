			<p>
				A project was for rendering fractals using raymarching.</br>
				This was my first main project that I worked on.
				I found out about a fractal online called a mandelbulb that could
				be rendered using SDF's. I quickly made a simple renderer
				using Swift and Metal. Over the next couple months, I continued to impliment
				more features. I improved the rendering to be more akin to a raytracer.
				I added setting to change the material and eventually impimented a node graph
				editor to control the shaders (inspired by Blender). Afterwards, I extended 
				the node graph so it could control the SDL as well. </br>
				I am currently working on rewriting the program in c++ with vulkan in the
				<a>Kaleidescope</a> program
